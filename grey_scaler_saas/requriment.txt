CREATE A WALLET FOR DB SOURCE

- previously we created a grey_scaler. at there we uploaded images and converted them to grey scale and set a download for that images.
- now the requirement is, it has to be downloaded when the  "user only pay for it".

- goto main.py -- class objects --- after "password" variable -- add;
    wallet = db.Column(db.Integer, default = 0)
    hassubscription = db.Column(db.Boolean, default = 0)

- check it;
